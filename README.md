# Hi there! 👋 I'm Nikunj Madan

## 🎓 Currently
MS in Artificial Intelligence | Nanyang Technological University, Singapore | **CGPA: 4.6**


**Specializations:** Generative AI for Visual Synthesis | Urban Computing | Text Data Management & Analysis
**Currently Studying:** Deep Learning | Multi-agent Systems | Advanced Computer Vision

## 🚀 About Me
I'm curious and love learning new tech stacks to see how they are incorporated in industry level applications. I enjoy building projects and exploring new technologies. I'm passionate about playing around with data to work on real-world problems and creating solutions that make an impact.

## 💼 Past Experience
ZS Associates | Business Technology Solutions Associate Consultant *(Aug 2022 – Jun 2025)*
- Built ETL pipelines processing 2-3 terabytes of data using Spark
- Led backend development for pharmaceutical clients with R and PostgreSQL
- Developed automated dashboards and tools for data analytics and reporting primarily used by internal teams and clients (in hospitality and pharmaceutical fields)

## 📚 Research
- [**"Architects Companion: Simulation of Visual Impairments for Architectural Purpose"**](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-21385-4_36) - ICAIDS 2021
- [**"Machine learning techniques for disease prediction in rice plant"**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10760293) - ICSSAS 2024

## 💻 Featured Projects

### Movie Recommendation System  
Analyzes movie's metadeta and incorporates content-based filtering techniques to make personalised recommendations
- **Tech / Skills:** Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Streamlit
- Data processing, creating a recommendation system using TV-IVF vectorizer and cosine similarity, and streamlit based web-application

### Learned Dynamic Channel Pruning
Modifies Stable Diffusion 1.5 model in order to reduce peak memory consumption while preserving image generation quality and speed
- **Tech / Skills:** Python, Diffusion Models, Generative AI, PyTorch
- **Channel Importance Scoring Module:** provides each channel with an importance score that determines whether the channel will be enabled or disabled during inference.
- **Pruning and Replacement Module:** Applying pruning to the convolution layers and replacing the original U-Net with the pruned U-Net.
- The importance scores are optimized using reconstruction loss and sparsity loss. Where the reconstruction loss preserves the channels that provide image quality and the sparsity loss encourages pruning. The optimal point provides the best memory reduction while at the same time preserving the image generation quality.
- Hyperparameter tuning and Ablation studies is performed

### Trajectory and Road Analysis
Evaluating and improving the map matching performance in urban environments
- **Tech / Skills:** Python, OSMNX, Matplotlib, Fast Map Matching, ST Matching Algorithm
- Data processing, map matching using FMM, hyperparameter tuning, and visualizing geographic trajectories

### Yelp Reviews Data Analysis and Processing
Covers data analysis and processing of customer reviews data and creating applications to generate meaningful insights.
- **Tech / Skills:** Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Data processing, stemming, VADER sentiment analysis, and negation detection

### Football Match Win Predictor
Machine learning model for predicting English Premier League match outcomes
- **Tech / Skills:** Python, Scikit-learn, Web Scraping
- Data processing, model optimization, and performance visualization

## 🌱 Currently Learning
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- RAG and Agentic AI
